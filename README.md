## Bugs, Fixes & Upcoming Improvements

 - An improvement I need to make to this project would be to make everyones payroll number unique and this can be done by either storing and reading it from a xlsx file or  a static arraylist.
 - In terms of testing I have not properly tested the full cage functionality so I am unsure whether it works as intended.
 - When you chose a pallet and you enter space it can end up breaking the program so that is something I need to have a proper look at.
